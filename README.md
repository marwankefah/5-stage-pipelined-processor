# 5-stage Pipelined Processor
<br>A simple 5-stage pipelined processor based on the Harvard Architecture.
## Introduction
  The processor in this project has a RISC-like instruction set architecture. There are eight 4-byte general purpose registers; R0, till R7. Another two general purpose registers, One works as program counter (PC). And the other, works as a stack pointer (SP).
The initial value of SP is (2^32-1). The memory address space is 4 GB of 16-bit width and is word addressable.
The size of the bus between the memory and the processor is 32 bits for instruction memory and data memory.

  When an interrupt occurs, the processor finishes the currently fetched instruction, then the address of the next instruction (in PC) is saved on top of the stack, and PC is loaded from address [2-3] of the memory (the address takes two words). To return from an interrupt, an RTI instruction loads PC from the top of stack, and the flow of the program resumes from the instruction after the interrupted instruction.

## Design
### Summary
The processor's data path is divided into five pipeline stages, each containing one of the classic RISC pipeline operations: Instruction fetch **(IF)**, Instruction decode and register fetch **(ID)**, Execute **(EX)**, Memory access **(MEM)**, and Register write back **(WB)**. Each stage is implemented through a pipeline buffer register, four of them between each one of the stages: **IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/MEM, and MEM/WB**. A centralized _Control Unit_ at the ID stage writes the appropriate control signals for each instruction operation code, some of which pass through the pipeline. To maintain the consistency and reliability of data retrieval throughout the pipeline stages, a _Forwarding Unit_ forwards data through the pipeline to the appropriate stage. In cases where a stall or discarding of the entire pipeline is needed, a _Hazard Detection Unit_ overwrites instruction control signals to achieve the required result. An _Interrupt Handling Unit_ handles cases where an external signal (INT or RST) overwrites the pipeline, or when executing a multicycle instruction.
